# Pingpong
This was an assignment gotten through a coursera course at Rice University on programming games in python. 

Due to the way the class was set up, the instructors developed their own in-browser GUI, called simplegui, and therefore can only be run using the CodeSkulptor text editor. 

A link to a working version of this program can be found [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_mw0ZRQH5Ej_22.py).
